Instructions:
1. To add images, gifs, or videos, create an "assets" folder in the project root directory.

2. Place all media files (images, gifs, videos) inside the assets folder.

3. Reference media files in HTML like this:
   - For images/gifs:
     <img src="assets/filename.jpg" alt="description" />

   - For videos:
     <video src="assets/filename.mp4" controls></video>

4. For embedded YouTube videos, keep the iframe src as the YouTube URL.

5. Update image or video URLs in the HTML files as needed to point to your uploaded assets.

This setup allows you to keep media files organized and makes the site easier to maintain and update.
